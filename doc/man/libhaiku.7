libhaiku \- Poetic error messages
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B libhaiku
is an API on top of a collection of haiku, that lets a programmer
make a program print haiku for error messages. Instead of calling
.BR perror (3),
the program should call
.BR libhaiku_perror (3).
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR perror (3)
.SH "KNOWN ISSUES"
Must of the haiku uses 5\-7\-5 syllables rather than 5\-7\-5 morae.
This is however of lesser importance, as it is much harder to write
a 5\-7\-5 mora haiku than a 5\-7\-5 syllable haiku.
